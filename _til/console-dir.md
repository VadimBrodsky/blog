The `console.dir()`[^1] method is the way to see all the properties of a specified JavaScript object in console, very useful to get the properties of the object in the browser console.

> The method console.dir() displays an interactive list of the properties of the specified JavaScript object. The output is presented as a hierarchical listing with disclosure triangles that let you see the contents of child objects.

```javascript
console.dir(object);
```
