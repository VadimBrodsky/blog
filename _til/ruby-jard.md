Just Another Ruby Debugger

A Ruby debugger[^1] that has an interesting mix of `byebug` and `pry`

> Ruby Jard provides a rich Terminal UI that visualizes everything your need, navigates your program with pleasure, stops at matter places only, reduces manual and mental efforts. You can now focus on real debugging.
